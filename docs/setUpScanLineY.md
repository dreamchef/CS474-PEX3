#method

creates an instance of the [[Scanline]] to/from a pair of vertices (handles horizontal cases)

the `current` values in the outputs from this function are the `start` and `end` values in the outputs from [[setupScanLineX]]

Essentially functions as an outer loop for the y-dimension

#question why do we need a scanline y?
